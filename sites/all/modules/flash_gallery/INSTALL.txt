Flash Gallery for Drupal 6.x: Installation instructions
-------------------------------------------------------

Install steps:

* Download flash gallery module and unpack it to your site's modules
  directory.

* The simpleviewer swf player is included in the package. As well as the swfobject.js
  You can download the latest version from Airtight Interactive
  (http://www.airtightinteractive.com/simpleviewer).
  
* You will notice that the viewer and swfobject are located in the
  directory called 'simpleviewer' (modules/flash_gallery/simpleviewer/).

  Your directory and file structure should look like this:

  	  modules/
  	    [... other module directories ...]
  	  	flash_gallery/
  	  		flash_gallery.css
  	  		flash_gallery.info
  	  		flash_gallery.module
  	  		INSTALL.txt
  	  		LICENSE.txt
  	  		simpleviewer/
  	  			swfobject.js
  	  			viewer.swf
            translations/
                flash_gallery-module.hu.po

* Enable the module @ administer > Site Building > modules.  It is
  listed in the Media section, and needs image and image_gallery
  enabled first.

* Change the settings @ administer > Content Management > flash galleries

* If you already have some image_gallery galleries with images in them, check
  'build thumbnail library' in the miscellaneous section and hit save

* Go to http://yoursite.com/admin/content/fgallery to adjust properties.
  If you already have image galleries createdm then you will need to rebuild
  the thumbnails. Click on Miscellaneous and check "build thumbnail library.
  You can also change dimensions, colors and layout

* If you do not have image galleries created. Go to admin/content/image and
  start creating them.
  Add images and select which galleries they should go under.

* Suggestion: set a path alias for fgallery

* Suggestion: disable all blocks on fgallery/* as this will give you more
  space to display your albums
